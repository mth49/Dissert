# Dissert
Contains the data entries for transient & steady state data from experiments using water tunnel 0.4-0 steps 0.1 m/s. Teensy IMU & Barnacle (five-point probe)
Arduino code functions but needs touching up
Matlab files are present to generate visual displays. Use the import files present or import the data files from the excel format then use for the analysis.
The Arduino has an informative document for a breakdown of the code before the sparkfun9250IMU-I2C is combined with comments still required to make easier to understand
